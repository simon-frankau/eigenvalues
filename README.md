# Random matrix eigenvalue toy

## What is this about?

Based on https://twitter.com/sigfpe/status/984889330467352576, I
learnt about https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_law, which seems
pretty cool. I wanted to play about with it myself, and perhaps
understand the way in which the points kind of repel each other.

It's also a nice excuse to do a little more Rust and some
computational linear algebra (aka use the `nalgebra` library).

## Getting started

```
cargo +nightly run eigenvalues
```
